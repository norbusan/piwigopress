From any open API Piwigo gallery, swiftly include your photos in
Posts/Pages and/or add randomized thumbnails and menus in your sidebar.

== Description ==

On the one hand, PiwigoPress is a WordPress **Sidebar Widget** that links
your blog to some public pictures of a Piwigo gallery.  Thus, a Piwigo
gallery with several public pictures in it is a prerequisite to make it
working. But even if you don't have one yet, you can nonetheless give this
plugin a try by using the Official Piwigo [demonstration gallery][] before
setting up your own gallery.

PiwigoPress generates several highly valuable links in sidebars of your
WordPress blog, all of them being optional: a thumbnail linking to
the corresponding picture page, menus directing to all albums defined
as public in the gallery, several additional links to most recent, most
viewed, most commented pictures, and more.

On the other hand, by using **a shortcode** [PiwigoPress ...] you can add
any public picture of a Piwigo gallery. Here again you should try even
though you don't have yet your Piwigo Gallery. Have a look with
[PiwigoPress id=72 url='http://piwigo.org/demo'] in a post or page.

Above all, PiwigoPress provides a shortcode **generator**. Each time you
add some pictures to your gallery you will be able to add a post related
to your last uploaded photos. So, your friends and family are going to
like your photos and Search Engines are going reference your gallery with
the refbacks provided by PiwigoPress.

When you've finished testing and want to create you own gallery, go to the
Piwigo [download page][], where you'll find all the links you might need.

Try "NetInstall" first. If it fails, switch to the "Package" download and
follow the full installation procedure. When ready, if you are a bit lost,
just try Photos add page sheets (Web form, Applications, FTP + Synchronization) 
in your Piwigo gallery administration page.

Development of PiwigoPress is open to contributions, please use the
[github page][] for patches, bug reports, and issues.

How to install manually PiwigoPress and get it working ? (automatic

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Widget (only): How can I get any thumbnails ? =
* Just have the URL without the /index.php? on the end.
* Just have recent pictures in the gallery.
* Change Since X months (0=all) from 12 to 0
* Set "Number of pictures (0=none)" to 1 or 2  
* If it doesn't work, see the provided screenshots...

= How can I get other sizes ? I only have thumbs and squares. =
* In your gallery admin pages, find Configuration 
and there select: Options > Photo sizes > Multiple size > show details

= How can I get squared thumbnails ? =
* maybe you should try to upgrade your gallery to Piwigo 2.4.x or above.
* See screenshots

= Widget (Only): With Link type Album which album would be selected ? =
If Album = 0 the link will remain to the picture page.
Otherwise, if Number of pictures > 0 the first picture will link the Album page, next pictures will refer to their picture page.

= Shortcode (Only): With Link type Album which album would be selected ? =
Picture is going to have a link to its most recent Album page (Upcoming releases should cover other cases).

= Shortcode generator (only): Why did I get a warning message ? =
* Message is "No available public picture or Piwigo release < 2.4.x" (Won't be translated)
* Disconnect you from the gallery and try to access to any Albums, maybe all pictures are locked or private
* Second possible cause: Old piwigo release. Only recent releases (2.4 and above) provide several picture sizes.
* Backward compatibility below Piwigo 2.4 is limited to Widget sidebar functions

= How do I arrange images horizontally? =

Since images are generated in the following way:
`````
<div id="..." class="PiwigoPress_photoblog">
   <div class="PWGP_shortcode <something>">
      ...img...
    </div>
</div>
`````
horizontal alignment can easily be achieved by adding the following code
to either custom css or child theme css:
`````
.PiwigoPress_photoblog {
  display:inline-block;
}
.PWGP_shortcode {
  display:inline-block;
}
`````

== Screenshots ==

2. Expected result in your sidebar
3. Widget parameters for your gallery (on the same domain)
4. Piwigo admin Photo sizes (from a Gallery website)
5. PiwigoPress shortcode samples
6. PiwigoPress shortcode generator above Post/Page editor usable with both Visual/HTML editor.
7. Buttons, Drag and Drop zones for a total intuitive interface.
8. Generation and insertion of the shortcodes are done at caret (insert cursor) position.
9. Expected result on your page or post of your Wordpress blog.
